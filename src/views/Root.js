          At the time of writing, this website is simply an playground for me to flex my software developer skillset.
          This website is built in React.js via AWS Amplify: a serverless approach to building apps and websites (cool, right!?).
          I am primarily and Backend developer, so if the Frontend works smoothly and find the design aesthetically pleasing, then please let me know so I can get myself and enjoy a vegan cookie. üç™<br />
